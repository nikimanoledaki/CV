## Introduction
I have wanted to become a software engineer for the past 4+ years, which I was finally able to do upon finishing my bachelor's degree. In the meantime, I took every opportunity to learn about technology. I am ambitious and excited to start my career in this creative and innovative field.

## Background

I have 6+ years of experience with NGOs. I worked for grassroots that operate in refugee camps in Greece for a year. Upon returning to university in London, I co-founded Boxwise, a warehouse management application for NGOs that distribute donations in refugee camps. At the moment, the application is used in 7 refugee camps in Greece and services over ten thousand people. 

Last July, I graduated from King's College London with a bachelor's degree in International Relations. I wrote a dissertation about the societal impact of bias in machine learning. I also completed courses Cybersecurity and in Calculus while at university.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I have worked on.

## Skills

#### Motivated Self Starter

- During the prototype days of Boxwise, I pitched the prototype at competitions. I was a finalist for the **Change-Maker Award** from the King’s College Entrepreneurship Institute. My team also received the **European Youth Award** in the category Managing Life.

- During Makers, I came up with an idea for a **chatbot that teaches people about personal finance and uses machine learning** in the backend. I was able to form a team and successfully made it happen.

#### Communication

- I pitched my idea for an automated inventory management tool for NGOs in front of hundreds of people at the **Techfugee Summit** at Station F in Paris in 2017, which is how I formed my team of open-source developers. People who felt moved by my speech came up to me after my pitch.

- Towards the later weeks of the Makers course, I wrote a Medium article about [getting started with Machine Learning](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/machine-learning-for-beginners-84c23e090b18). The purpose of this was to share it with the rest of the team as a crash course, because for me it is very important to ensure that everyone feels like they have some ownership over the code and that no one is left behind.

#### Problem Solver

- During the second group project at Makers, I realised that the group's commit history was uneven while we were programming in pairs. In order to solve this, I proposed that we use a **git co-authoring tool** so that both people in a pair can receive credit for the piece of code they were working on.

- I studied International Relations and worked on the ground in Greece because I wanted to find solutions to global challenges. On the way, I realised that technology is a great vector for large-scale impact. Another lesson learned was that programming is also about  solving microscale puzzles continuously.
