I am a full-stack software engineer with experience using Ruby, JavaScript, and Python to write high-quality code and build fully-tested services. I co-founded an open-source warehouse management application used in refugee camps because I am passionate about tech for good. I also have some experience with UX, cybersecurity, and machine learning. I graduated from Makers Academy and King’s College London.

## Technologies & Skills

**Languages:** Ruby, Go, JavaScript, Python, CSS/HTML </br>
**Frameworks:** Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Django, React</br>
**Testing:** RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, unittest</br>
**Databases:** PostgreSQL</br>
**Distributed Systems & Networking:** Apache Kafka, Git, Unix systems</br>
**Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, Jupyter Notebook</br>
**Deployment:** Travis CI, Heroku, AWS EC2, Docker

#### Innovation
During the early days of Boxwise, I had to pitch our prototype at competitions and convince the judges that this was something worth investing in. I was a finalist for the **Change-Maker Award** from the King’s College Entrepreneurship Institute. My team also received the **European Youth Award** in the category Managing Life. These investments helped me start something I believe in.

#### Self-Learning
I am an avid and fast learner. I follow new books from publications such as O'Reilly and Manning closely and wrote a Medium article about [getting started with Machine Learning](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/machine-learning-for-beginners-84c23e090b18). In order to do this, I had to set up an AWS EC2 machine learning instance, through which I learned about Keras models and Jupyter notebooks.

#### Communication

I enjoy speaking in public. For example, I pitched my idea for an automated inventory management tool for NGOs in front of hundreds of people and industry leaders at the **Techfugee Summit** at Station F in Paris in 2017, which is how I formed my team of open-source developers. People who felt moved by my speech came up to me after my pitch.

#### Teamwork

During Makers, I came up with an idea for a **chatbot that teaches people about personal finance and uses machine learning** in the backend. It was based on the idea of empowering people through financial literacy. My peers and I formed a team and successfully made it happen. I am always there for my peers to listen and motivate them because I strongly stand by the conviction that, in a team, no one should be left behind.
  
#### Problem Solving

During the second group project at Makers, I realised that the group's commit history was uneven. I proposed that we use a **git co-authoring tool** so that both people in a pair can receive credit.

I studied International Relations because I wanted to find solutions to global challenges. I realised that technology is a great vector for large-scale problem-solving. Similarly, programming is about solving microscale puzzles continuously.
