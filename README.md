## Introduction
I am an ambitious junior developer specializing in JavaScript and Ruby. I've wanted to become a software engineer for the past 4+ years and took every opportunity to learn more about the field.

## Background

I have 6+ years of experience with NGOs. I worked on the ground in refugee camps in Greece for a year. Upon returning to London, I co-founded Boxwise, a warehouse management application for NGOs that distribute donations in refugee camps. At the moment, it is used in 7 refugee camps in Greece and services over ten thousand people. 

Last July, I graduated from King's College London with a bachelor's degree in International Relations. I wrote a dissertation about the societal impact of bias in machine learning and completed courses in Cybersecurity and Calculus.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I have worked on.

## Skills

#### Motivated Self Starter
During the prototype days of Boxwise, I pitched the prototype at competitions. I was a finalist for the **Change-Maker Award** from the King’s College Entrepreneurship Institute. My team also received the **European Youth Award** in the category Managing Life.

I wrote a Medium article about [getting started with Machine Learning](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/machine-learning-for-beginners-84c23e090b18). I set up an AWS EC2 machine learning instance to learn more about Keras models and Jupyter notebooks.

#### Communication

I pitched my idea for an automated inventory management tool for NGOs in front of hundreds of people at the **Techfugee Summit** at Station F in Paris in 2017, which is how I formed my team of open-source developers. People who felt moved by my speech came up to me after my pitch.

During Makers, I came up with an idea for a **chatbot that teaches people about personal finance and uses machine learning** in the backend. My peers and I formed a team and successfully made it happen.
  
#### Problem Solver

During the second group project at Makers, I realised that the group's commit history was uneven. I proposed that we use a **git co-authoring tool** so that both people in a pair can receive credit.

I studied International Relations because I wanted to find solutions to global challenges. I realised that technology is a great vector for large-scale problem-solving. Similarly, programming is about solving microscale puzzles continuously.
