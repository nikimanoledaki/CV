## Skills

#### Innovation & Creativity

I co-created an original warehousing system to replace the traditional systems of organising donations in warehouses after a year of experience of working on the ground. During the early days of Boxwise, I pitched our prototype at competitions and presented our idea in front of judges and large audiences. I was a finalist for the **Change-Maker Award** from the King’s College Entrepreneurship Institute and my team also received the **European Youth Award** in the category Managing Life.

I recently created a portfolio website for a filmmaker and illustrator based in London, which you are welcome to visit here: [https://www.arisalazar.com](https://www.arisalazar.com).

#### Self-Learning

I am curious, an avid reader and fast learner. I completed the MIT courses `6.0001 on Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python` and `6.824: Distributed Systems`, and am now following Kelsey Hightower's `Kubernetes the Hard Way` to learn more about containerisation and cloud computing. I read up on new publications from publishers such as O'Reilly and Manning and wrote a Medium article about [getting started with Machine Learning](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/machine-learning-for-beginners-84c23e090b18).

#### Communication & Teamwork

During Makers, I came up with an idea for a **chatbot that teaches people about personal finance and uses machine learning** in the backend. It was based on the idea of empowering people through financial literacy. My peers and I formed a team and made it happen. I believe in service leadership and will always be there for my peers to listen and motivate them because I strongly stand by the conviction that, in a team, no one should be left behind.

## Hobbies

**Learning new languages.** Fluent in French, Greek, and English, studied Mandarin Chinese for 6 years, conversational in Spanish, learning Catalan.</br>
**Attending Meetups** e.g. Codebar, AI for Good, AI & JavaScript, London Gophers, Microsoft Reactor events</br>
**Reading literary fiction, hiking, biking, and yoga.**
