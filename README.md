## Niki Manoledaki

I am a full-stack Ruby and JavaScript software developer. Sometimes I write about new technologies that I try out on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@niki.manoledaki). I love solving problems, which is why I developed a warehouse management application for NGOs that distribute donations in refugees camps in Greece prior to Makers. I recently graduated from King's College London with a Bachelor's degree in International Relations.
